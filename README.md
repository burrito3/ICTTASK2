# Carnival Registration App - README

## Overview
This repository contains the code for the "Carnival Registration App," a software solution developed for a school's sports carnival administration. The app aims to streamline the enrollment process for students and marshals, allowing students to self-enroll in various sports events while marshals can enroll students and view event entrants. The school values student participation and, therefore, the app also provides the ability to view the number of events each student is enrolled in.

## Problem Breakdown
The problem involves creating a user-friendly app that caters to both students and marshals. The app's main functionalities include:
- **Student Enrollment:** Students should be able to self-enroll in sports events, and they must only be allowed to enroll themselves in events.
- **Event Limit:** Each event has a limit of 8 entries, which should be enforced by the app to prevent over-enrollment.
- **Marshal Enrollment:** Marshals have the authority to enroll students in events on their behalf.
- **Event Entrants Viewing:** Marshals should be able to view the list of entrants for any event.
- **Student Participation Tracking:** Marshals need to view the number of events each student is enrolled in to ensure balanced participation.

## Specifications
The app is designed to meet the following specifications:

### User Interface
